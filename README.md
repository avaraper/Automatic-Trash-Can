# Automatic-Trash-Can
For the upcoming programming, we plan on programming a code that will take the stored data, 
and then once it hits a certain point it will send an SMS/ email to the desired person when 
the trash can is half full and full. The new programming skills which we will be learning are 
how to connect to the internet and store data as well as how to program an SMS/ email. 
We plan on figuring out how to develop these tools by reaching out to people with programming 
skills, getting help from the school, and lastly going onto the internet.
